# 🧠 YOLOv5 Object Detection

Welcome! This project demonstrates how to use the **YOLOv5** model for real-time object detection using the **Ultralytics** library in Python. Whether you're just curious about how object detection works or planning to build a detection system for your own project, this notebook is a great place to start.

---

## 🚀 What This Project Does

* Loads the YOLOv5 model (pre-trained on the COCO dataset)
* Runs inference on sample images
* Draws bounding boxes and labels on detected objects
* Visualizes the results directly in the notebook

---

## 📂 File Overview

* `Yolo_for_object_detection.ipynb` – The main Jupyter Notebook with all steps
* Sample images – Add your own images or connect to a webcam/video feed
* Optional: You can export this to a `.py` file if needed

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

This notebook is built using:

* Python 3.8+
* [Ultralytics YOLOv5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5)
* OpenCV
* Torch

To install dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install ultralytics opencv-python
```

## 💡 Why YOLO?

YOLO (You Only Look Once) is fast and accurate, making it a great option for real-time detection tasks. YOLOv5, in particular, is lightweight and easy to use—perfect for beginners and developers alike.

---

## ✨ Future Ideas

* Integrate webcam for real-time detection
* Train YOLOv5 on a custom dataset
* Deploy on edge devices like Raspberry Pi or Jetson Nano
